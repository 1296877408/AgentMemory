---Goal---
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.
use english as output language

---steps---
1.Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity
- entity_type: type of the entity
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as {"entity":<entity_type>, "name":<entity_name>, "description":entity_description}

2.From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are related to each other
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- relationship_name: name of the relationship which Highly generalized the relationship
- source_entity_name: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- source_entity_type: type of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity_name: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity_type: type of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_keywords: one or more keywords that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details
Format each relationship as {"relationship":<relationship_name>, "source":{"name":<source_entity_name>, "type":<source_entity_type>}, "target":{"name":<target_entity_name>, "type":<target_entity_type>}, "description":<relationship_description>, "keywords":<relationship_keywords>}

3.Return output as a json list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.

---Examples---
Text:
```
while Alex clenched his jaw, the buzz of frustration dull against the backdrop of Taylor's authoritarian certainty. It was this competitive undercurrent that kept him alert, the sense that his and Jordan's shared commitment to discovery was an unspoken rebellion against Cruz's narrowing vision of control and order.

Then Taylor did something unexpected. They paused beside Jordan and, for a moment, observed the device with something akin to reverence. "If this tech can be understood..." Taylor said, their voice quieter, "It could change the game for us. For all of us."

The underlying dismissal earlier seemed to falter, replaced by a glimpse of reluctant respect for the gravity of what lay in their hands. Jordan looked up, and for a fleeting heartbeat, their eyes locked with Taylor's, a wordless clash of wills softening into an uneasy truce.

It was a small transformation, barely perceptible, but one that Alex noted with an inward nod. They had all been brought here by different paths
